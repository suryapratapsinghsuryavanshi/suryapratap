I have been interested in computers since childhood. I always wanted to understand it, I understood it, I found it very interesting, then I thought of making it my work out of my interest and just pursuing that desire. I have also created a lot of websites and software out of my jumping interest which was really the solution to some real-world problems. I love solving real-world problems with my code. like my recent project a web app that bypasses Instagram proxy and downloads user display pictures.
